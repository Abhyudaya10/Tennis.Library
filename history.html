      <h1 class="hp1">Origins & Early Beginnings</h1>
      <p class="p1">
        The game of tennis has a long history, with roots reaching back to
        ancient civilizations. Although the exact origins are difficult to
        trace, it is widely believed that games involving balls and hitting
        motions were popular in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. These early
        games shared basic concepts with tennis but were far less structured.
        The version most similar to modern tennis took shape in medieval France
        with a game called Jeu de Paume, or “game of the palm,” which emerged
        around the 12th century. In Jeu de Paume, players initially struck the
        ball with their hands, but as the game progressed, they began to use
        leather gloves and paddles to improve control. Eventually, these paddles
        evolved into the first rackets, setting the foundation for a more
        sophisticated sport. By the 16th century, Jeu de Paume had transformed
        into "real tennis," which introduced enclosed courts, specialized rules,
        and scoring terms that remain in modern tennis, such as “love” and
        “deuce.” Real tennis grew in popularity among European nobility,
        particularly in England and France. In fact, King Henry VIII of England
        was an avid player and championed the game, helping to establish it as a
        royal pastime. Despite its popularity, real tennis remained largely an
        exclusive sport, limited to the aristocracy and played primarily in
        indoor courts. This version of the game laid down principles and scoring
        systems that would significantly influence the modern game of lawn
        tennis.

      <h1 class="hp2">The Birth of Mordern Tennis</h1>
      <p class="p2">
        Modern tennis, often referred to as lawn tennis, was officially born in
        the 19th century and was popularized through the efforts of Major Walter
        Clopton Wingfield. In 1873, Wingfield created a game called
        “Sphairistikè” (Greek for “ball-playing”) and developed a version that
        could be played on a grass surface, which was more accessible and suited
        for outdoor play. This new adaptation took elements from real tennis but
        modified them to create a simpler, more recreational activity that could
        be enjoyed by the public. Lawn tennis rapidly gained popularity in
        Victorian Britain, where it appealed to both men and women as an
        elegant, social sport. In 1877, the All England Club, based in
        Wimbledon, codified a standardized set of rules and dimensions for the
        court and net, which they used for the first official Wimbledon
        Championship. This tournament, initially featuring only men’s singles,
        marked the birth of competitive modern tennis. As Wimbledon grew in
        prestige, other championships emerged, and lawn tennis started to take
        shape as an international sport. By the late 19th century, additional
        events, such as doubles matches and women’s competitions, were
        introduced, further expanding the sport’s reach and appeal. Lawn tennis
        thus evolved from a leisure activity into an organized competitive sport
        with established rules, which were soon adopted worldwide.

      </div>

      <h1 class="hp3">Expansion & Globalization</h1>
      <p class="p3">
        The popularity of tennis quickly spread beyond Britain to countries
        across Europe and North America. During the late 19th and early 20th
        centuries, tennis clubs began to emerge in these regions, and the sport
        became accessible to a broader range of social classes and communities.
        Unlike real tennis, which had been largely confined to royalty and
        aristocrats, lawn tennis found enthusiastic support from middle and
        working-class people, making it a truly international game. The founding
        of the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) in 1913, with
        representatives from 12 nations, marked a major milestone in tennis
        history. The ILTF was established to promote the sport globally,
        ensuring consistency in rules and standards across borders. This
        organization also played a crucial role in formalizing the Grand Slam
        tournaments. Wimbledon (established in 1877), the US Open (1881), the
        French Open (1891), and the Australian Open (1905) were already
        prominent tournaments, but they were united under the Grand Slam label
        in the 1920s, making them the pinnacle of competitive tennis. Each Grand
        Slam offered unique challenges due to differences in court surfaces:
        grass at Wimbledon, clay at the French Open, and hard courts at the US
        Open and Australian Open. These surface variations brought out diverse
        playing styles and strategies, adding layers of skill and versatility to
        the game. By the mid-20th century, tennis had become one of the world’s
        most widely played sports, with millions of recreational and competitive
        players, as well as growing media coverage of tournaments.

      <h1 class="hp4">The Open Era</h1>
      <p class="p4">
        The year 1968 marked a transformative period in tennis history, ushering
        in what is known as the Open Era. Before this time, tennis tournaments
        were divided into separate amateur and professional circuits, which
        limited competition and created a distinct hierarchy in the sport. With
        the advent of the Open Era, professional players were allowed to compete
        alongside amateurs in all tournaments, including the prestigious Grand
        Slams. This decision immediately increased the level of competition and
        attracted a larger, more diverse group of players. It also allowed
        tournaments to offer substantial prize money, paving the way for tennis
        to become a lucrative career path. The Open Era coincided with the rise
        of television broadcasting, which played a major role in making tennis a
        global spectacle. Stars such as Billie Jean King, Rod Laver, Bjorn Borg,
        Martina Navratilova, and Arthur Ashe became household names, and their
        rivalries captivated audiences around the world. Technological
        advancements also contributed to the sport's evolution. Racket materials
        shifted from wood to aluminum, and then to lighter, more durable
        graphite, allowing players to hit with more power and precision. Changes
        in strategy, particularly the shift from serve-and-volley tactics to
        baseline-focused play, added complexity to the game. Sponsorships,
        endorsements, and branding transformed the professional circuit, making
        it more financially rewarding for players and raising the sport’s
        profile as a high-stakes international competition. The Open Era not
        only democratized tennis but also solidified it as one of the world’s
        most celebrated sports.
